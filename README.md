## How to Host on GitHub Pages
1. Create a new repository on GitHub (public) or use your existing one.
2. Upload the contents of this zip file (index.html) to the repository.
3. Ensure the main HTML file is named `index.html`.
4. Go to repository Settings -> Pages.
5. Select branch: main, folder: root (/).
6. Save and wait a few minutes. Your site will be live at: https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/
7. Open on iPhone or Android and tap "Add to Home Screen" to use as a native app.

## Replacing old repository

2. Click **Add file â†’ Upload files**, then drag the new `index.html` from this zip.
3. Click **Commit changes**. This will overwrite the old version.
